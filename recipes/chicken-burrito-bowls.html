        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large, boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cubed</li>
            <li>15 oz black beans, 1 can, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>1 white onion, diced</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>16 oz medium chunky salsa, 1 jar</li>
            <li>1 cup brown rice, cooked</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Green onion, salt, pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Toss in the onion with a pinch of salt and sauté until the 
                onions have softened, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Move the onions to the sides of the pan to create an open 
                space in the middle. Add the cubed chicken into the center 
                of the pan, season with salt and pepper, and sauté until 
                the chicken has cooked almost all the way through.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and mix until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Pour over salsa, black beans, and rice, and mix until 
                everything in the pan is evenly combined.</li>
            <li>Let the mixture simmer for 5 minutes or until the chicken 
                is cooked through.</li>
            <li>Divide the mixture equally into 4-6 bowls and sprinkle over 
                some thinly sliced green onions.</li>
        </ol>
