        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>One-Pot Creamy Stroganoff dish ready in 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>Easy to make and can substitute beef for chicken, turkey, or mushrooms.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>Ground beef (or can substitute for chicken or turkey).</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Mushrooms</li>
            <li>Mustard</li>
            <li>Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>Beef stock cube</li>
            <li>Egg noodles</li>
            <li>Sour cream</li>
            <li>Salt, black pepper</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Mustard</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the butter and oil in a Dutch oven. Add the ground meat, 
                break it up, and allow it to brown as best as possible.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, dice the onions and add them to the pot along with 
                the salt, pepper, and garlic.</li>
            <li>Slice the mushrooms and add them to the pot. Allow the mushrooms, 
                onions, and meat to cook for 4-5 minutes or until the onions and 
                mushrooms soften.</li>
            <li>Crumble in the stock cube, add the mustard, Worcestershire sauce, 
                and boiling water, and stir well to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the noodles and stir everything together. Crank up the heat 
                to max until the water comes to a boil, then reduce the heat to 
                medium-low, cover with a lid, and allow to cook, stirring 
                occasionally, according to the package instructions on the pasta.</li>
            <li>Once the pasta is done, the mixture should still be quite watery, 
                but the pasta will have absorbed a lot of the liquid. Remove the 
                pot from the heat, stir in the sour cream, and allow the pasta to 
                sit, covered, for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, chop the herbs (parsley or dill). After the stroganoff 
                has rested for 5 minutes, stir in the fresh herbs and serve.</li>
        </ol>
